Prerequisites
=============

For each Suite API request, you need:

 * your username for the API
 * your secret for the API
 * the URL of the Suite environment API you use (e.g.: ‘https://suite5.emarsys.net/api/v2/’)

This information is required to create the `API Authentication Header <http://documentation.emarsys.com/?page_id=1786>`_, which must be passed with every single request. If you do not have any of the data listed above, please contact your Account Manager.

.. note::

   * Always make sure not to reveal your API secret, for example by including it in plain text in the HTML or JavaScript source of your web page.
   * Your username for the eMarketing Suite API differs from the username for the eMarketing Suite GUI.
