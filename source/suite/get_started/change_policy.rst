Change Policy
=============

We are continuously improving our API. By focusing on introducing backward compatible changes, we are dedicated to
provide an API where our customers can focus on improving their service. Time to time, we might have to do
changes which will effect active API usage, but we do our best to share this information in advance. Our latest changes
and news will be available on our Whatâ€™s New page, and considerable changes will be advertised via our Customer Support
as well.
