Email Campaigns and Launches
============================

Email campaigns are templates and their settings which the Suite can launch.
The customer can create emails using the Suite UI, but also via the API.
Since the API does not allow using all features (e.g. templates), it may be
easier to use the API only to trigger the launches of email campaigns created
with the Suite UI.
