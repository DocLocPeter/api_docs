Use Cases
=========

This section describes some typical use cases for the eMarketing Suite API.

Use Case Groups
---------------

The use cases are divided into groups, covering similar actions but with increasing complexity. For example sending a
‘Welcome’ email without any bells and whistles is a simple use case, whereas sending a ‘Welcome’ email referring to a
product the contact has just bought is a more complex one.

We currently offer use cases covering these three activities:

* Sending transactional emails
* Sending batch email campaigns
* Updating contacts

If you would like to see use cases covering different marketing activities, please pass a request on to your Account Manager.

Optional Parameters
-------------------

There are optional parameters for most of the Suite API calls. We will describe only the parameters that you need to
use for the given use case.
