Use Cases
=========

This section describes some typical use cases for the Suite API. Although there are optional parameters for most of the
Suite API calls, only those parameters are described that you need to use for the given use case.

Use Case Groups
---------------

The use cases are divided into groups covering similar actions but with increasing complexity. For example sending a
welcome email without any bells and whistles is a simple use case, whereas sending a welcome email referring to a
product the contact has just bought is a more complex one.

We currently offer use cases covering these activities:

* :doc:`transactional_emails/index`
* :doc:`batch_emails/index`
* :doc:`keeping_contacts`
* :doc:`querying_contact_data`

If you would like to see use cases covering different marketing activities, please pass a request on to your Account Manager.
