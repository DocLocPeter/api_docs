Automation Center - Node integration
====================================

The Automation Center node integration API allows you to add a node to Automation Center that will call your service on a predefined HTTP endpoint. When the program reaches your node, it will call the specified URL with a set of parameters, which you can use to trigger necessary actions for the contacts entering the node.

In the first section we describe the HTTP interface that needs to be implemented by each service. The second section will introduce you to an example service written in PHP. The third section offers best practices recommended by Emarsys. In the last section you can read about planned changes to the API.
