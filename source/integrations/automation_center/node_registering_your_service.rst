Registering your service with Automation Center
===============================================

At this point we do not have a UI for registering services, so this will need to be handled by the Automation
Center team. Please send the following information to your contact person:

 * Please attach two icons:
    * A 20x20 pixel icon, that will appear on the toolbar
    * A 50x50 pixel icon, that will be used inside the editor.
    * If the new node is going to be available for a large number of customers, the icons should be created by the
      graphic designer of Suite (Maria Niebelschütz)
 * A name for your service that will appear next to the icon.
 * Describe which customers should have access to the API node. (All customers, or customers with a given feature.)
 * Trigger endpoint URL - The URL that needs to be called when the program wants to trigger your service
 * If your service does not use resources:
    * A label, that will appear below the nodes.
 * If your service uses the resource options endpoint:
    * Resource options endpoint URL
    * A label that will appear below the nodes, and will be followed by the resource name.
 * If your service uses the ‘Custom node dialogue endpoint’:
    * Custom node dialogue endpoint URL

Based on this information the Automation Center team will add your service to the Program_Service_Catalog,
and notify you when it is available. First we will add the service with a flipper, so that the new node can
be tested by the implementer before it is released to the customers.
