Registering your service with Automation Center
===============================================

At this point, we do not have a UI for registering services, so this will need to be handled by the Automation
Center team. Please send the following information to your contact person:

 * two icons:

   * a 20x20 pixel icon that will appear on the toolbar
   * a 50x50 pixel icon that will be used inside the editor

 * a name for your service that will appear next to the icon
 * description about which customers should have access to the API node (all customers or customers with a given feature)
 * trigger endpoint URL - the URL that needs to be called when the program wants to trigger your service
 * a label that will appear below the nodes (if your service does not use resources)
 * resource options endpoint URL (if your service uses the resource options endpoint)
 * a label that will appear below the nodes and will be followed by the resource name (if your service uses the resource options endpoint)
 * custom node dialogue endpoint URL (if your service uses the custom node dialogue endpoint)

.. note::

   If the new node is going to be available for a large number of customers, the icons should be created by the
   graphic designer of Suite (Maria Niebelsch√ºtz)

Based on this information, the Automation Center team will add your service to the Program_Service_Catalog
and notify you when it is available. First, the service will be added with a flipper so that the new node can
be tested by the implementer before it is released to the customers.
