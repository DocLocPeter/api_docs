Registering your service with Automation Center
===============================================

At this point, we do not have a UI for registering services, so this will need to be handled by the Automation
Center team. Please send the following information to your contact person:

 * two icons:

   * a 20x20 pixel icon that will appear on the toolbar
   * a 50x50 pixel icon that will be used inside the editor
   * If the new node is going to be available for a large number of customers, the icons should be created by the
     graphic designer of Suite (Maria Niebelschütz)

 * a name for your service that will appear next to the icon
 * Describe which customers should have access to the API node (all customers or customers with a given feature).
 * Trigger endpoint URL - the URL that needs to be called when the program wants to trigger your service
 * If your service does not use resources:

   * a label that will appear below the nodes

 * If your service uses the resource options endpoint:

   * resource options endpoint URL
   * a label that will appear below the nodes and will be followed by the resource name

 * If your service uses the ‘Custom node dialogue endpoint’:

   * custom node dialogue endpoint URL

Based on this information, the Automation Center team will add your service to the Program_Service_Catalog,
and notify you when it is available. First, the service will be added with a flipper so that the new node can
be tested by the implementer before it is released to the customers.
