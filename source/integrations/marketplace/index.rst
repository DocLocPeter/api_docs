Marketplace
===========

Marketplace is a future feature where Emarsys customers can install and remove add-ons (the integration).
The Suite application reports these lifecycle events to the integration, and it also passes relevant
customer information optionally. Based on these, the integration can set up users or do other administration tasks.

HTTP Interfaces
---------------

In these pages, we describe the HTTP interface which needs to be implemented for each Marketplace
integration.
